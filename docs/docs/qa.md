# Quality Assurance

Key aspects of the Quality Assurance checklist that DataGEMS services must pass have been defined in the processes and documents governing the platform development and quality assurance. 

For the case of DataGEMS Data Workflow Orchestrator we rely on the the [Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/) workflow solution which is a well established and widely used [open source](https://github.com/apache/airflow) project.
